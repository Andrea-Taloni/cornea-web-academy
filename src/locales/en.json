        "paragraph1": "Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (DALK) is a surgical procedure that involves selective transplantation of the corneal stroma while preserving the recipient's Descemet membrane and endothelium.",
        "paragraph2": "For decades, penetrating keratoplasty (PK) has been considered the mainstay surgical treatment for eyes affected by corneal stromal diseases. More recently, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) has become an alternative to PK, with the advantages of eliminating the risk of endothelial rejection (which occurs in approximately 20-30% of penetrating keratoplasty cases over 10 years) and avoiding the complications associated with open-sky surgery [1].",
        "paragraph3": "Despite these undisputed advantages, the uptake of DALK among corneal surgeons has been relatively slow [2]. Longer surgical time, steep learning curve, and low patient volume have been reported as the most important barriers to adoption of DALK [3].",
        "paragraph4": "Different techniques to perform DALK have been proposed, including layer-by-layer manual dissection, pneumatic dissection, and viscoelastic-assisted dissection. The method of pneumatic dissection through injection of a \"big bubble\" described by Anwar represents the most popular surgical method [4].",
        "paragraph5": "In 2017, Busin et al. have introduced a modified technique using larger 9-mm grafts with clearance limited to a central 6-mm optical zone, demonstrating superior visual and refractive outcomes while minimizing complications [5]."

          "Two-piece microkeratome-assisted Mushroom Penetrating Keratoplasty (PK) is a corneal transplantation technique that employs a mushroom-shaped graft with a larger 9.0mm anterior lamella and smaller 6.0mm posterior lamella. This technique is indicated for eyes with full-thickness central corneal opacities but otherwise healthy peripheral endothelium.",
          "The technique represents a paradigm shift in corneal transplantation by addressing the critical limitation of conventional PK: the inverse relationship between graft size and immunologic rejection risk. By transplanting only the central 6mm of endothelium while maintaining a 9mm optical zone, mushroom PK preserves approximately 75% of the recipient endothelium. This minimal endothelial replacement strategy dramatically reduces the antigenic load and provides a biological reservoir for endothelial cell migration, explaining the exceptionally low rejection rates (<5% at 5 years) observed even in vascularized corneas [1].",
          "The microkeratome-assisted approach involves splitting the donor cornea into anterior and posterior lamellae using a 200μm head on an automated lamellar therapeutic keratoplasty (ALTK) system. This method overcomes the limitations of femtosecond laser-assisted techniques, allowing successful dissection through densely scarred and vascularized tissue. The recipient bed is prepared with a 9mm peripheral lamellar dissection at 250μm depth, followed by central 6mm full-thickness trephination, creating the characteristic stepped wound configuration [1]."

While Mushroom PK shows slightly higher astigmatism (approximately 0.86D more) and increased endothelial cell loss, the technique maintains excellent graft survival (94.12% at 5 years) and provides a safe bailout option when DALK cannot be completed due to Descemet membrane macroperforation."
