  "Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK) is a partial-thickness corneal transplant that replaces only the diseased endothelium and Descemet's membrane along with a thin layer of posterior stroma. This revolutionary technique, developed in the early 2000s, has largely replaced penetrating keratoplasty for isolated endothelial dysfunction.",

  "DSAEK offers significant advantages over full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty, including faster visual recovery, stronger wound integrity, and reduced risk of complications. The procedure involves transplanting a donor disc approximately 100-200 Î¼m thick, containing healthy endothelium, Descemet's membrane, and a thin layer of posterior stroma.",

  "With over 15 years of widespread clinical use, DSAEK has proven to be a reliable and reproducible technique with excellent long-term outcomes. The procedure maintains structural integrity of the eye, induces predictable refractive changes, and achieves 5-year graft survival rates exceeding 95% in appropriate candidates.",
